# Dante Audio Failover

This project is created to join the popular networked audio ecosystem "Dante."
This project aims to fill the need for easily integrating a backup device into a Dante Network. This program leverages the ease of use of Dante and the speed of the ASIO audio driver, all in a very simple, lean package.

## Requirements
***This driver only works on windows and it requires the 
machine to have a Dante Virtual Soundcard Installed***
 * [ASIO Driver](https://www.steinberg.net/developers/)
 * [libremidi](https://github.com/jcelerier/libremidi)
